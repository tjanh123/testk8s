# test k8s eureka
<p>This repo is to test of using eureka in kubernetes.
<p>In fact, event Kubernetes supports Load Balancer and Service Discovery but i wan't to test if Eureka works properly. 
<p>Of course, it doesn't work :) 
<p>In my example, i just run the Service Discovery, Test-1 and Test-2. And then, call service to Test-1/call to see if Test-1 can get the call to Test-2 and boom...... i have the result. So, you dont need to run all container like nginx or Test-3 to test - even they can be failed while building ^^!. 
<p>I think there are others having same ideal.
<p>Don't hesitate to leave your comment or send me the feedback to my email ttrung.mai@gmail.com. Thank you a lot.
<p>Have Fun !!!
